Facebook Marketplace is a platform for buying and selling products on Facebook. This project involves training a multimodal deep neural network model that predicts the category of a product based on its image and text description. The trained model is then dockerized and served using FastAPI.

The multimodel model learning is a scaled down implementation of a part of a larger system that Facebook developed to generate product recommendation rankings for buyers.
